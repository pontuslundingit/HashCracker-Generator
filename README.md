This is a Hash Cracker / Generator. 
You create an account which will be stored in MySQL via Docker, or you login with your GitHub-account (oauth2).
Then you can create a Hash, either MD5 or SHA256.
You can also crosscheck your hashes with a list consisting of the most common passwords (ca 100k)
If it hits you'll get notified that the hash is cracked and what the actual password is.
